A PHP client for the Heroku Platform API, similar to [platform-api](https://github.com/heroku/platform-api) for Ruby and [node-heroku-client](https://github.com/heroku/node-heroku-client) for Node.js. With it you can create and alter Heroku apps, install or remove add-ons, scale resources up and down, and use any other capabilities documented by the [Platform API Reference](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference).

## Features
- Reads `HEROKU_API_KEY` for zero-config use
- Returns JSON-decoded Heroku API responses
- Exposes response headers (necessary for some API functionality)
- Uses a built-in cURL-based HTTP client or one that you provide
- Accepts cURL options and custom request headers
- Throws informative exceptions for authentication, JSON, and HTTP errors
- Designed around the [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) (Request/Response) and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/) (HTTP client) standards

## Requirements
- PHP 7 (For PHP 5.6 use our 1.x branch)
- cURL, unless providing an HTTP client without cURL dependencies (such as [Socket Client](http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/clients/socket-client.html))

## Installation
```
$ composer require php-heroku-client/php-heroku-client
```

## Quick start
Instantiate the client:
```php
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use HerokuClient\Client as HerokuClient;

$heroku = new HerokuClient([
    'apiKey' => 'my-api-key', // Or set the HEROKU_API_KEY environmental variable
]);
```
Find out how many web dynos are currently running:
```php
$currentDynos = $heroku->get('apps/my-heroku-app-name/formation/web')->quantity;
```
Scale up:
```php
// patch() and post() accept an array or object as a body.
$heroku->patch(
    'apps/my-heroku-app-name/formation/web',
    ['quantity' => $currentDynos + 1]
);
```
Find out how many more calls we can make in the near future:
```php
// Underlying PSR-7 Request and Response objects are available for header inspection and general debugging.
$remainingCalls = $heroku->getLastHttpResponse()->getHeaderLine('RateLimit-Remaining');
```

## Configuration
The client can be configured at instantiation with these settings, all of which are optional and have sane defaults:
```php
new HerokuClient([
    'apiKey' => 'my-api-key',                 // If not set, the client finds HEROKU_API_KEY or fails
    'baseUrl' => 'http://custom.base.url/',   // Defaults to https://api.heroku.com/
    'httpClient' => $myFavoriteHttpClient,    // Any PSR-18 compatible HTTP client
    'curlOptions' => [                        // Options can be set when using the default HTTP client
        CURLOPT_TIMEOUT => 10,
        CURLOPT_USERAGENT => 'My Agent',
        ...
    ],
]);
```

## Making calls
Make calls using the client's `get()`, `delete()`, `head()`, `patch()`, and `post()` methods. The first argument is always the required `string` path and the last is always an optional `array` of custom headers. `patch()` and `post()` take an `array` or `object` body as the second argument. These methods return the `\stdClass` object that results from JSON-decoding the Heroku API response.
- See the [Quick Start](#quick-start) for examples with and without a body.
- See the full [Platform API Reference](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference) for a list of all endpoints and their responses.

## Using headers
The Heroku API uses headers as a separate channel for [range](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#ranges), [rate limit](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#rate-limits), and [caching](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#caching) information. You can read and send headers like this:
```php
$page1 = $heroku->get('apps');

// 206 Partial Content means there are more records to get.
if ($heroku->getLastHttpResponse()->getStatusCode() == 206) {
    $nextRange = $heroku->getLastHttpResponse()->getHeaderLine('Next-Range');
    $page2 = $heroku->get('apps', ['Range' => $nextRange]);
}
```

## Using other Request/Response features
Underlying HTTP requests and responses are exposed via the `getLastHttpRequest()` and `getLastHttpResponse()` methods. These return instances of [Guzzle's implementations](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/psr7.html) of the [PSR-7 Request and Response interfaces](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/). Note that the Response body is a stream, so it has [special handling considerations](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/latest/psr7.html#streams). Response bodies are rewound by this client so that you can access them again immediately with a call to `getBody()->getContents()` on the Response. The properties exposed via the `getLast...()` methods are nulled initially and whenever you call one of the entry point methods (`get`/`delete`/`head`/`patch`/`post`), then set again as soon as their corresponding objects are generated. So for certain failures (such as a hard network error in the HTTP client) `getLastHttpRequest()` would return the attempted Request object while `getLastHttpResponse()` would return `null`.

## Reacting to problems
You may wish to recognize and react to specific error conditions. In this example we use the API's [data integrity mechanism](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/platform-api-reference#data-integrity) to require that the requested data hasn't changed since an earlier call. If it has, we will receive a `412 Precondition Failed` response. We handle that case specially, then catch more general situations:
```php
use HerokuClient\Exception\BadHttpStatusException;

try {
    $heroku->get('some/path', ['If-Match' => $eTagFromEarlierCall]);
} catch (BadHttpStatusException $exception) {
    if ($heroku->getLastHttpResponse()->getStatusCode() == 412) {
        // React to the fact that our requested data has changed.
    } else {
        // React to all other bad HTTP status codes.
    }
} catch (\Exception $exception) {
    // React to all other problems.
}
```

## Exceptions thrown
- `BadHttpStatusException`
- `JsonDecodingException`
- `JsonEncodingException`
- `MissingApiKeyException`

In addition to exceptions thrown directly from this API client, [standardized exceptions](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/#clientexceptioninterface) may bubble up from the HTTP client.
